# Python Data Processing with GitHub Actions CI/CD

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Python data processing task. It reads data from a CSV file, calculates a summary using Pandas, and automatically publishes the JSON output to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The pipeline also includes a linting step with Ruff.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: A Python script (`execute.py`) that reads `data.csv` and computes total revenue per product.
- **Linting**: Code quality is checked on every push using the [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) linter.
- **CI/CD Automation**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automates the entire process of testing, building, and deploying.
- **Automated Publishing**: The final output, `result.json`, is automatically generated and deployed to GitHub Pages, ensuring it is never committed to the repository.
- **Dependency Management**: Python dependencies are clearly defined for reproducible builds.

## Project Structure

**Note**: `result.json` is intentionally not included in the repository as it is a build artifact generated by the CI pipeline.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.11+

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
    cd YOUR_REPO
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Unix/macOS
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file is not included, but you can install the necessary packages directly:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas==2.3.0 ruff
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Linter

To check the code quality with Ruff, run:

```bash
ruff check .
```

### Executing the Script

To run the data processing script and see the JSON output in your terminal, execute:

```bash
python execute.py
```

To save the output to a file, similar to the CI process:

```bash
python execute.py > my_result.json
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the core of this project's automation. It is triggered on every `push` to the `main` branch.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1.  **Checkout**: Clones the repository code.
2.  **Setup Python**: Initializes a Python 3.11 environment.
3.  **Install Dependencies**: Installs `pandas` and `ruff` using pip.
4.  **Run Ruff Linter**: Scans the codebase for linting errors and style issues.
5.  **Run Script**: Executes `execute.py` and redirects its standard output to create the `result.json` file.
6.  **Configure & Deploy Pages**: The workflow then uses standard actions to package `result.json` as a GitHub Pages artifact and deploy it.

## GitHub Pages Output

The `result.json` file generated by the CI pipeline is automatically published and can be accessed live.

-   **Live URL**: [https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/result.json](https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/result.json)

This ensures that the latest data output is always available at a stable URL without requiring manual updates.
